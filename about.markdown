I'm a naturally curious software developer with a deep passion for understanding how things work. With extensive experience in information security, compilers development, backend development, application development, team management, and Android development, I've developed a diverse skill set that allows me to excel in multiple areas of software development.

What really excites me is the intersection of __AI__, __compilers__, and __cyber security__. I love exploring the fascinating connections between these fields and discovering innovative solutions. As a clean code enthusiast, I take pride in my ability to independently plan and execute projects from start to finish.

I currently work at [Lightricks](https://www.lightricks.com/) as a Senior Android developer.
